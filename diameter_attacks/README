The tools supports several of the attack scenarios described in FS.19.
For each attack scenario different Diameter messages of different 3GPP interfaces can be sent.
Currently only S6a is supported.

The attack scenario is identified by a script containing the main and a configuration file.

Basic usage examples:

python <attacck_scenario_script> -svt client -c <conf_file> <remote-host-ip>      
python <attacck_scenario_script> -svt server -c <conf file> -a <accept-remote-ip> 
      <local-ip>      

e.g. 
python information_gathering.py -svt client -c conf/information_gathering_cer_cea.cnf 63.141.228.110 
python information_gathering.py -svt server -c conf/information_gathering_cer_cea.cnf -a 63.141.228.110 80.116.201.159 

Description of config files to use for attacks are reported in each attack scenario script.
